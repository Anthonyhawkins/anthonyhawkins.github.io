# More About Me

I spent days trying to write the perfect about page. But then I thought, who’s really going to read about what I do at Mastercard? Why bother going through all the lengthy details about my time as a site reliability engineer, working in DevOps, or that one time I was part of a really cool cloud-native greenfield project? Nah, nobody will care. I should at least mention that I currently work with Go and TCP/gRPC-based services.

I gave it a rest for a few days, then came back to it, what if I told my crazy story of how I failed programming in high school, followed a guildmate’s advice while playing World of Warcraft, and moved across the country to start my IT career and taught myself to code again? Better, but again, is it really important to mention that? I cut that out too.

Maybe a humbler approach was the way to go… I figured I should at least mention that I’m fortunate to lead a team of very talented engineers who are always teaching me new things. Eh, that’s too fluffy—never mind.

Oh! I know, I’ll mention something unique about myself, like my brief stint in graphic design and how I enjoy making pretty diagrams and pictures. But again, that seems off-topic, *delete*.

Another day went by… Why is this so hard? Just. Keep. It. Simple.

My name is Anthony. By day, I’m currently a lead software development engineer at Mastercard. In the evenings, I enjoy dabbling in side projects that interest me. Most of them end up in the trash, but the two I actually launched are [1000 Italian Words](https://1000italianwords.com/) and [SmeeGuides](https://smeeguides.com/).

I use this blog primarily to write my thoughts and opinions on various topics in the IT and Software Development Industry. I also find fulfillment in providing guidance and mentorship to those who are new to tech and programming.

Above all, I’m a father and married to a beautiful wife.

Eh, good enough.
